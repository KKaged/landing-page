# landing-page

This project will my first ever "proper" landing page. I will be using FlexBox amongst other things to comeplete this.

Today's date is 12/16/2022

My goal is to be a full stack web developer either be in Japan, USA or anywhere else in the world. That is my goal.

To those that read this and are having trouble on how to learn programming, I really suggest 'The Odin Project'. It's free and a great learning source. You can go on your own pace. This FREE course sets you up to be the best developer you can be. They even prepare you for job interviews.

Thank you for reading.
